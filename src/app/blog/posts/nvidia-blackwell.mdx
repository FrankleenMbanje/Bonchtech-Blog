Software eats the world, but hardware feeds the software. NVIDIA's announcement of the **Blackwell** architecture is a watershed moment for the AI industry.

## Trillion-Parameter Scale

We are hitting the limits of what current clusters can train efficiently. Blackwell is designed specifically to enable the training and inference of models with **trillions of parameters**.
*   **20 PetaFLOPS** of FP4 compute power (per chip).
*   **NVLink Switch:** Allowing 576 GPUs to talk to each other as if they were a single massive chip.

## Energy Efficiency

One of the biggest criticisms of the AI boom is its energy cost. Blackwell promises up to **25x lower cost and energy consumption** for running massive LLMs compared to the previous Hopper generation.

## Why It Matters for Agents
Agentic workflows require fast inference. When an agent has to "think" (reason, plan, reflect), it generates many tokens. Faster, cheaper inference means we can build more complex, capable agents that can think longer and deeper without breaking the bank or the power grid.
