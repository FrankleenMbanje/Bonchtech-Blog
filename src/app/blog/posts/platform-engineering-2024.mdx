DevOps changed the culture, but **Platform Engineering** is changing the implementation. In 2024, expecting every developer to be a Kubernetes expert is no longer a viable strategy.

## The Cognitive Load Problem

"You build it, you run it" successfully broke down silos, but it also dumped immense cognitive load on application developers. They had to know React, Node.js, Docker, Terraform, Helm, and AWS networking.

## Enter the IDP (Internal Developer Platform)

Platform Engineering treats the internal infrastructure as a *product*. The consumers are the developers.
*   **Golden Paths:** Pre-configured templates for spinning up services that are secure and compliant by default.
*   **Self-Service:** Developers can provision databases or preview environments via a CLI or portal (like Backstage) without waiting for Ops tickets.

## The Security Benefit
By standardizing the platform, security is baked in. You don't have to worry if a junior dev left an S3 bucket open, because the platform's "Create S3 Bucket" template forces encryption and private access by default.

It's not about restricting developers; it's about removing the friction that slows them down.
