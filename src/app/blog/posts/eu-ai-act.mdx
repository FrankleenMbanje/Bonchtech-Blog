The **EU AI Act** is the GDPR of Artificial Intelligence. It categorizes AI systems by risk and sets strict compliance requirements.

## Risk Categories

1.  **Unacceptable Risk:** Banned outright (e.g., social scoring systems, real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces).
2.  **High Risk:** Strictly regulated (e.g., AI in critical infrastructure, education, employment, law enforcement). Requires rigorous testing, documentation, and human oversight.
3.  **Limited Risk:** Transparency obligations (e.g., chatbots must disclose they are machines).
4.  **Minimal Risk:** Unregulated (e.g., spam filters, video games).

## The Open Source Debate
There was intense debate about how this applies to open-source models. The final text includes exemptions for open-source AI models unless they are "high-risk" or systemic.

## Global Impact
Just like GDPR, the "Brussels Effect" means this law will likely set the global standard. Tech companies worldwide will adapt their products to be EU-compliant, effectively making these the global rules of the road.
