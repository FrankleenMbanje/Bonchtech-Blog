Generative AI is often associated with art and text, but its most profound impact may be in **Science**.

## AlphaFold and Biology

DeepMind's **AlphaFold** solved a problem that had stumped biologists for 50 years: predicting the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence. This has unlocked new pathways for drug discovery and understanding diseases.

## Material Science
AI models act as "simulators" for new materials. Instead of synthesizing thousands of compounds in a lab, researchers can use AI to predict the properties of millions of potential materials—batteries, solar panels, superconductors—and only test the most promising ones.

## The Feedback Loop
This creates a flywheel:
1.  AI designs a material.
2.  Robots synthesize it.
3.  The results (success/failure) are fed back into the AI to improve the next prediction.

We are entering an age of **Self-Driving Labs**.
