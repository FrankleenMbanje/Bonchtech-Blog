In Deep Learning, there's an empirical observation known as the **Scaling Laws**: As you increase the amount of compute, the size of the dataset, and the number of parameters in a model, performance improves predictably.

## The Recipe for Intelligence

It seems almost too simple. We don't necessarily need clever new algorithms; we just need **more**.
*   **More Compute:** Hence the demand for H100s and Blackwell GPUs.
*   **More Data:** The race to ingest the entire internet, video, and code repositories.
*   **More Parameters:** Moving from billions to trillions.

## Diminishing Returns?

Skeptics argue we will hit a wall. Data may run out (the "token crisis"). Compute costs may become unsustainable. However, recent breakthroughs in synthetic data generation and more efficient architectures suggest the ceiling is still far above us.

## Implications for Business
For now, the moat is compute and data. Companies that can afford to train the largest models will have the smartest agents. Everyone else will be renting intelligence from them.
