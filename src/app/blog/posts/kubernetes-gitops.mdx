**GitOps** is the operational framework where the state of your infrastructure is defined in a Git repository. **Kubernetes** is the engine that makes that state a reality. Together, they are the gold standard for modern deployment.

## Declarative vs. Imperative

*   **Imperative:** "Run this script to install Nginx." (Fragile, hard to replicate)
*   **Declarative:** "I want 3 replicas of Nginx version 1.25 running." (Robust, self-healing)

## The GitOps Workflow
1.  Developer pushes code to Git.
2.  CI pipeline builds a Docker image.
3.  CD tool (ArgoCD or Flux) notices the change in the Git repo.
4.  ArgoCD syncs the Kubernetes cluster to match the Git state.

## Drift Detection
If someone manually changes a setting on the cluster (e.g., via `kubectl edit`), ArgoCD detects the "drift" from the Git source of truth and automatically reverts it. This enforces consistency and prevents "configuration drift," a major cause of outages.
