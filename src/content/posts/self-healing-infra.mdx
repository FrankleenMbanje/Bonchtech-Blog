# When the System Fixes Itself

Downtime is inevitable. But prolonged downtime is a choice. In traditional DevOps, an alert wakes up an engineer at 3 AM. In **Agentic DevOps**, the system wakes up, diagnoses the issue, and fixes it before the engineer even checks their phone.

## The Healer Pattern

We use a simple but powerful pattern called the "Healer Loop":

1.  **Monitor**: A Python script polls the health endpoint every 10 seconds.
2.  **Diagnose**: If a 500 error is detected, the logs are sent to an LLM for analysis.
3.  **Prescribe**: The LLM suggests a fix (e.g., "Restart the Docker container", "Rollback to commit SHA-123").
4.  **Act**: n8n executes the prescribed action via SSH or API.
5.  **Verify**: The Monitor confirms the service is back up.

## Implementation with n8n

Our n8n workflow is the central nervous system. It listens for webhooks from the monitoring script.

The workflow has a `Switch` node that routes distinct error types to specialized sub-workflows. Database connection errors trigger a pool restart. Memory leaks trigger a graceful service reboot.

## The Result

Since implementing this self-healing architecture, our Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) has dropped from 45 minutes to **22 seconds**. The infrastructure isn't just robust; it's antifragile.
