# The Workflow Attack Vector

Automation platforms like n8n are powerful, but they also introduce a new attack surface. If your webhook URL is exposed, an attacker could trigger your workflows, potentially deleting data or consuming expensive API credits.

## 1. Verify the Source

Never trust the payload blindly. Always implement a shared secret check.

In your n8n webhook node, add a "Header Auth" credential. If the client doesn't send the correct `X-Bonch-Token`, the workflow should terminate immediately.

## 2. Payload Validation

Use the `Schema` node (or a `Code` node) to validate the structure of the incoming data. If you expect an email address, ensure it *looks* like an email address before passing it to your CRM.

```javascript
// Validation Example in n8n Code Node
const payload = items[0].json;
if (!payload.email || !payload.email.includes('@')) {
  throw new Error("Invalid payload: Email is required");
}
return items;
```

## 3. Rate Limiting

Self-hosted n8n instances can be DDOSed easily. Place your n8n instance behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik and implement strict rate limiting on the `/webhook/*` endpoints.

## Conclusion

Security isn't a feature; it's a process. By treating your automation workflows with the same rigor as your production code, you ensure that your efficiency gains don't become security liabilities.
